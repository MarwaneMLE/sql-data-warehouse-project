DDL Script: Create Gold Views
=====================================================================================
Script Purpose:
  This script  creates views for the Gold layer in the data warehouse
  The Gold layer represents the final dimension and fact tables (Star Schema)

  Each view performs tranformations and combines data from the silver layer
  to produce a clean, enriched, and business-ready dataset.

Usage:
  - These views can be queried directly for analytics and reporting.
